Note : Can add Users in the database but admin is just a single entity. I havent added admin into the database
hence he cannot change his username nor his password
Credentials for admin:

Username : admin
password : Admin321

I have added reset events in admin dashboard just in case if the table doesn't seem to display any event
nor if the tickets are exhausted, you can do it to make sure the values from events.dat are reuploaded into
the database to get fresher pre-existing data from event.dat (the newly added data not from event.dat will be
destroyed however)
